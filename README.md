Description:
GitHub Repository: [Link to Your Repository]

Overview:
Welcome to the "Classification of Wine Quality" project repository! This machine learning project employs a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the quality of wines based on a set of essential chemical parameters. 

Dataset:
The project utilizes a dataset containing the following attributes: 
1. Fixed Acidity
2. Volatile Acidity
3. Citric Acid
4. Residual Sugar
5. Chlorides
6. Free Sulfur Dioxide
7. Total Sulfur Dioxide
8. Density
9. pH
10. Sulphates
11. Alcohol

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can classify wines into different quality categories based on the input features. The dataset typically includes wine quality ratings, allowing the model to learn and make predictions based on these ratings.

Methodology:
This repository showcases the implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier, a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. Naive Bayes is well-suited for this project because it handles multi-class classification efficiently, making it an excellent choice for categorizing wine quality.

Key Features:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes data preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling to ensure the dataset is ready for model training.
2. **Naive Bayes Classifier**: The core of the project is the implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier. The classifier is trained on a subset of the dataset to predict wine quality accurately.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the performance of the Naive Bayes classifier.
4. **Visualization**: Visualizations of data distributions, confusion matrices, and classification reports are provided to gain insights into model performance.
5. **Model Deployment (Optional)**: If applicable, the repository may include code and instructions for deploying the trained model for real-world predictions.
